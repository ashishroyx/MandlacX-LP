## 🛠️ Tech Decisions

- **React** (`react`, `react-dom`): The main JavaScript library used for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS** (`tailwindcss`, `@tailwindcss/vite`): Utility-first CSS framework for styling UI efficiently.
- **Three.js** (`three`): Core 3D rendering engine.
- **React Three Fiber** (`@react-three/fiber`): React renderer for Three.js to build 3D scenes declaratively.
- **Drei** (`@react-three/drei`): Helper components for common 3D tasks (e.g., orbit controls, loaders).
